# Metagenomics analysis

Hello!

This repository contains all the code and stuff used during the 16s metagenomics analysis.

This pipeline utilises [snakemake](snakemake.readthedocs.io) to handle all the data analysis.
To run snakemake, we first need to install snakemake.
If using conda, run the command:

```
conda install -c bioconda snakemake
```
